# KDP Strategist Functional Implementation - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical gaps identified in the KDP Strategist AI Agent application to transform it from a partially implemented prototype (~40-60% complete) into a fully functional, production-ready system. The current codebase has excellent architecture and design but suffers from incomplete implementations, mock data dependencies, and integration issues that prevent successful compilation and execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Application Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to compile and run without errors, so that I can begin testing and using the core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server is started THEN the application SHALL start without import errors or dependency conflicts
2. WHEN the frontend is launched THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the backend API without connection failures
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return properly formatted responses without server errors
4. IF external API services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the application starts THEN all required environment variables SHALL be validated and missing ones reported clearly

### Requirement 2: Real Data Integration

**User Story:** As a KDP publisher, I want to analyze real market trends and competition data, so that I can make informed decisions about profitable niches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request trend validation THEN the system SHALL fetch real Google Trends data using the pytrends library
2. WHEN I analyze competitor ASINs THEN the system SHALL attempt to retrieve real Amazon product data or provide meaningful mock data with clear indicators
3. WHEN I discover niches THEN the system SHALL combine real trend data with competition analysis to generate actionable insights
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff strategies and cache responses appropriately
5. WHEN external APIs fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached data or clearly indicate data limitations

### Requirement 3: Database and Persistence Layer

**User Story:** As a user, I want my analysis results to be saved and retrievable, so that I can track my research over time and avoid re-running expensive API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform niche discovery THEN the results SHALL be stored in a local database for future reference
2. WHEN I request previously analyzed data THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from storage without re-calling external APIs
3. WHEN the cache expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh data from external sources
4. IF the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with reduced functionality
5. WHEN I export analysis results THEN the system SHALL provide data in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

### Requirement 4: API Client Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable API integrations with proper error handling, so that the application remains stable under various network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Google Trends client is called THEN it SHALL handle rate limiting, timeouts, and network errors gracefully
2. WHEN the Keepa API client is used THEN it SHALL validate API keys and provide meaningful error messages for authentication failures
3. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL log errors and return default values without crashing
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff
5. WHEN API quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when quotas reset

### Requirement 5: Frontend-Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a KDP publisher, I want a responsive web interface that displays real-time analysis results with interactive charts and data visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit a niche discovery request THEN the frontend SHALL display loading indicators and progress updates
2. WHEN analysis results are returned THEN they SHALL be displayed in interactive charts and tables
3. WHEN I filter or sort results THEN the interface SHALL respond immediately without backend calls
4. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
5. WHEN I export results THEN the download SHALL begin immediately with proper file formatting

### Requirement 6: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management with environment-specific settings, so that the application can be easily deployed across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables and config files
2. WHEN required API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for obtaining and configuring them
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
4. IF optional features are disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function with reduced capabilities
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload settings without requiring a full restart

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels and context information
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and retry attempts
3. WHEN users encounter errors THEN they SHALL receive user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. IF system resources are low THEN the application SHALL log warnings and potentially reduce functionality
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution traces without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times for analysis requests, so that I can efficiently research multiple niches without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request cached data THEN it SHALL be returned within 100ms
2. WHEN I perform new analysis THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and estimated completion times
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN response times SHALL remain consistent under load
4. IF analysis takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL allow users to cancel requests
5. WHEN the system is under heavy load THEN it SHALL queue requests and process them in order

### Requirement 9: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance tools, so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL verify core functionality remains intact
2. WHEN API integrations are tested THEN mock services SHALL simulate various response scenarios
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
4. IF tests fail THEN the deployment process SHALL be halted with clear failure reasons
5. WHEN performance tests are run THEN they SHALL validate response times and resource usage

### Requirement 10: Documentation and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN I SHALL find comprehensive setup and usage documentation
2. WHEN I encounter API errors THEN the documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting steps
3. WHEN I want to extend functionality THEN developer documentation SHALL explain the architecture and extension points
4. IF I need examples THEN the documentation SHALL include real-world use cases and sample outputs
5. WHEN features are updated THEN the documentation SHALL be automatically updated to reflect changes
